## Exercises/Exploration

Look up a version of top-down merge sort for lists that doesn't pass in
the length of the list.  How is the list split in half?  How much list
traversing is done for the whole sorting algorithm in the two versions?

Compare and contrast the array and list versions of top-down merge sort.

Code versions of bottom-up and natural merge sort for lists.
