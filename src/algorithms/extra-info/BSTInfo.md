## Exercises/Exploration

The "balanced" input option is designed to produce a best possible
ordering for building a binary search tree.  Can you figure out how it
works? Can you design an algorithm to produce this ordering?

How can the code be modified to allow duplicate keys? How does having
duplicate keys impact on search (note that in general we have keys and
values stored)?
