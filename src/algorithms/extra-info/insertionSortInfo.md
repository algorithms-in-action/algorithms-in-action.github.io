## Exercises/Exploration


Compare Insertion Sort with Merge Sort.
	- Why is Insertion Sort often preferred for very small subarrays inside Merge Sort implementations?
	- How does the asymptotic complexity differ between the two?



Try tracing Insertion Sort on an array of size 6–8 that is reverse-sorted.
	- How many shifts (element moves) are required in total?
	- How does this compare to the number of comparisons?



Think about the adaptiveness of Insertion Sort.
	- Why does Insertion Sort work particularly well on nearly sorted arrays?
	- Can you identify a real-world dataset where this property would be beneficial?
