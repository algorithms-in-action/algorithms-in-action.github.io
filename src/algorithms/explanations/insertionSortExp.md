**# Insertion sort**



**---**



**Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. The whole list is divided into 2 parts, one sorted part and one unsorted part. Each time we pick a number in the unsorted part and put it into the sorted part according to the sequence.**

**Insertion sort is a very simple sorting algorithm, but with higher  complexity. The average case and worst case** 

**behavior <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>.  Which the worst case of insertion sort is happened when  A variant that reduces**

**the likelihood of this worst case behavior with only a few extra lines**

**of code is the \*Median of Three\* strategy, which is shown in a different**

**AIA module.**
