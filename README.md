## Deployment

Algorithms in Action is written in JavaScript, using the React framework. To work on it locally, you will need to install Node.js on your machine. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that will allow us to view the website locally. NPM (Node package manager) is installed alongside when Node is installed. It is a multipurpose tool that will install 3rd party dependencies, start the app, and run test suites.

**First-time Setup**

Ensure you have node version 14.x and npm version 6.x or higher

To verify, type the following commands in your terminal/ command prompt -

`node --version`

`npm --version`

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies in package.json

**Running a local development server**

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `npm start` this will start the development server on your local machine on port 3000. The application will be launched automatically in your default browser at http://localhost:3000
