## Deployment

Algorithms in Action is written in JavaScript, using the React framework. To work on it locally, you will need to install Node.js on your machine. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that will allow us to view the website locally. NPM (Node package manager) is installed alongside when Node is installed. It is a multipurpose tool that will install 3rd party dependencies, start the app, and run test suites.

### First-time Setup

Ensure you have python 3.9.x, node version 18.x and npm version 9.x or higher

To verify, type the following commands in your terminal/ command prompt -

`node --version`

`npm --version`

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies in package.json

### Running a local development server

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `npm start` this will start the development server on your local machine on port 3000. The application will be launched automatically in your default browser at <http://localhost:3000>

## Demo

We currently have an accessible link to the application, link has shows as above.

This [link](https://algorithms-in-action.github.io/) above includes changes made by teams at the end of each sprint and is accessible to anyone who has the link. The version of the algorithm in action web application in the above link tracks the changes made to the `dev` branch in the Github repository. When a pull request is submitted, approved, and merged into the `dev` branch from respective team branches, the application will be redeployed with the updated changes.

This [link](https://aia.davidsha.me/) is showing current team's work. It's a fast-tracking branch of alpha release which may be unstable. It has tracked with `feature/no-ref/union-find-algorithm` branch in the GitHub repository.

## Union-Find Algorithm Team

### Development

The main/master branch for this team is `feature/no-ref/union-find-algorithm`. All official changes made by the Union-Find Algorithm team will be made in this branch.

#### Changelog

Below we make notes on the dev process for the Union-Find Algorithm team.

* [x] After rebasing with the new changes made by the intern, an additional package `run-scripts-os` was added to `package.json` to fix the issue of the app not running on Windows machines.
* [x] Create new Union-Find algorithm.
